BIG 'O'

O(n) -> Linear
O(1) -> Constant
(O n^2) -> Quadratic

Identifying Runtime Complexity

For loop, fixed collection - Probably O(n)
Iterating through two different collections with separate for loops - O(n + m)
Two nested for loops iterating over the same collection - O(n^2)
Two nested for loops iterating over two separate collections - O (n * m)
Sorting - O(n*log(n))
Searching a sorted array - O(log(n))
